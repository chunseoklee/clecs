API Documentation

* Version link:http://clecs.muhuk.com/api/1.0.1[1.0.1]


Changelog
---------

.Changes Since Version 1.1.x

* Systems run inside an implicit transaction. ITransactableWorld is
removed.

* Components and systems are registered with worlds during
initialization.

** `clecs.backend.atom-world/make-world` is removed. Use
`atom-world` instead:
+
[source, Clojure]
----
;; TODO: Improve this example.
(atom-world components initial-transaction systems)
----

** `ISystemManager` is renamed as `IWorld`.
+
Following functions are removed from this protocol:

*** `remove-system!`

*** `set-system!`

*** `systems`

* `world/set-component` accepts entity-id and component type explicitly.
+
[source, Clojure]
----
;; Old way:
(comment
  (def c (->SomeComponent eid x y))
  (world/set-component w c))

;; New way:
(world/set-component w eid :my.ns/SomeComponent {:x x :y y})
----

* Queries are constructed using component type keywords instead
of records:
+
[source, Clojure]
----
;; Old way:
(comment
  (defrecord SomeComponent [eid])
  (def q (all SomeComponent)))

;; New way:
(def q (all :my.ns/SomeComponent))
----

* `clecs.core/make-world` is removed.

* Following deprecated functions are removed:

** `clecs.component/component?`

** `clecs.component/component-label`

** `clecs.component/component-type?`

** `clecs.component/defcomponent`

* Removed support for systems as functions.

* Deprecated `IComponent` is removed.


.Changes Since Version 1.0.x

* Components are no longer records. The same API still works but since
a java class is not generated anymore you are likely to get an error
like:
+
[source, Java]
----
java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: java_path.to.YourComponent
----
+
To solve this problem declare components in a `:require` instead
of `:import`. (Examples:
link:https://github.com/muhuk/clecs-examples/commit/a965ab138b888d3137742aa290be87d9e1528bd1[muhuk/clecs-examples@a965ab1]
& link:https://github.com/muhuk/clecs-examples/commit/22de34f592ca6cf3609e0822b9fd2ce6bf30afd0[muhuk/clecs-examples@22de34f])

* Added suport for systems as maps. Assuming `sys-fn` is an old
style system you can write a system as:
+
[source, Clojure]
----
{:process sys-fn}
----


.Changes Since Version 0.2.x

* Replaced function based queries with data driven queries. See `clecs.query`.
